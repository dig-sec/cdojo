.SYNOPSIS
This PowerShell script disables the requirement for pre-authentication for a specified Active Directory user.

.DESCRIPTION
The script uses the Get-ADUser cmdlet to retrieve the specified user from Active Directory. It then uses the Set-ADAccountControl cmdlet to modify the account control flags of the user, specifically setting the DoesNotRequirePreAuth flag to $true. This flag disables the requirement for pre-authentication, which can be useful for certain security testing scenarios.

.PARAMETER Identity
Specifies the identity of the user to modify. This can be a username, distinguished name, or GUID.

.EXAMPLE
Set-ADAccountControl -Identity "username" -DoesNotRequirePreAuth:$true
Disables pre-authentication requirement for the user with the specified username.

.NOTES
- This script requires the Active Directory module to be installed. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to modify user accounts in Active Directory.
- Use this script responsibly and only in authorized testing scenarios.
